# My Blog/Website
This is an attempt to make a fullstack website "from scratch" (I use quotes because I'm using frameworks).
This file is a blog about making a blog. Not very fun to read. But good to document!

## July 20th, 2022
So I'm starting by initializing a Django project and building some really basic HTML to get everything up and running. Next is to make a place for all the blog entries and link them to the database. 

## July 26, 2022
So I took 6 days or so off of this project to learn Django a bit better. I made some smaller sample projects and now I feel better equipped to frame this project up. 

Everything is working as expected now, and all that is left to do is... make the site. 

## July 27, 2022
Got the blog models to work with the database and feed stuff to the front end. 
Also, just got **markdown support** baby!! Very exciting. 

## July 28
Got a new navbar working, pushed to main branch. Also got `scss` support, which will be helpful with the more complex frontend animations and things. It was a complicated process -- there is a Django-specific tool that compiles the `scss` into `css` that needed to be installed manually, so there was some trial and error.
