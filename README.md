# My Blog/Website
This is an attempt to make a fullstack website "from scratch" (I use quotes because I'm using frameworks).
This file is a blog about making a blog. Not very fun to read. But good to document!

So I'm starting by initializing a Django project and building some really basic HTML to get everything up and running. Next is to make a place for all the blog entries and link them to the database.

So I took 6 days or so off of this project to learn Django a bit better. I made some smaller sample projects and now I feel better equipped to frame this project up. 

Everything is working as expected now, and all that is left to do is... make the site.

Got the blog models to work with the database and feed stuff to the front end. 
Also, just got **markdown support** baby!! Very exciting.
